      <h3>Leni Robredo's Legacy</h3>
      <p class="body-txt">
        Leni Robredo has been the major opposition of the late dictator's son Bong Bong Marcos Jr. She has captured the hearts of many of the youths and the likes; She is the embodiment of a public servant that is ready to put her body for the sake of the Filipino People.
      </p>  
      <p class="body-txt">
        She is the front and center of a revolution stained with pink, hope, and true patriotism that has created a ripple-effect that shook the foundation of our government. As the world moves forward to the 21st century, in need of progressive change, Robredo has been the signal the Filipino yearn for.
      </p>
      <p class="body-txt">
        Despite losing whether fairly or not. Leni Robredo still pursues to reach the needy and service our nation through the Angat Buhay Foundation, a non-government organization which aims to do what her program during her vice-presidency does; to help and rise the poor from poverty, truly sticking to its name.
